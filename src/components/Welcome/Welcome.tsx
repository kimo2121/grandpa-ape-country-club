          GACC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTsâ€”unique digital
          collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles
          as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only
          benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a
          collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked
          by the community through roadmap activation.
